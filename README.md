First download TASM (Turbo Assembler). Then put pixel.asm and flames.asm into the same directory as tasm.exe and tlink.exe. Then drag and drop tasm.exe into DOSBox. Then type tasm pixel (or tasm flames) and then type tlink pixel (or tlink flames). Now you can execute pixel.exe (or flames.exe.) by typing it. (It's an MS-Dos program.)
